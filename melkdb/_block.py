        In MelkDB, a block is a path of directories that
        are organized in sequence according to the

        created using the length of the key, the second
        part is created using the first letter of the key,
        and the last part is created using the last
        letter of the key.

        With this, we have an optimized path to facilitate
        the search for items in the database.
